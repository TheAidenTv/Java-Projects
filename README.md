## [Union Find (Disjoint Sets)](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/tree/main/Union%20Find) üñáÔ∏è

The Union Find Problem is a problem of grouping objects into sets and determining if they belong to the same set or not, with the goal of optimizing the performance of the algorithm.

I have coded 4 of the most common solutions or algorithms for solving this problem, they are as follows:
- [Quick Find](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/blob/main/Union%20Find/QuickFind.java)
- [Quick Union](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/blob/main/Union%20Find/QuickUnion.java)
- [Weighted Quick Union](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/blob/main/Union%20Find/WeightedQuickUnion.java)
- [Weighted Quick Union w/ Path Compression](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/blob/main/Union%20Find/WeightedQuickUnionPathCompression.java)

## [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAidenTv/Java-Projects/tree/main/Sorting%20Algorithms) üóÇÔ∏è

Sorting algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used to arrange a collection of elements in a specific order. There are many different sorting algorithms that you can use although some have a higher complexity than others. Below is a list of some of the most common sorting algorithms:
